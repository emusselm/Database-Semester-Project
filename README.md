# Database-Semester-Project
This is the repository for our database group project.
To run this project:
  1. Download a mySQL interface for loading and running SQL code. 
  2. Create a database called "store" to insert tables into. 
  3. Run StoreSchema.sql within the scope of the store database within the mySQL interface to intilize the tables on your machine. 
  4. If you populate the tables with data of your own, run the ClearStoreSchema.sql file to clear the tables. 

 *Code to populate the tables will be added soon.*
